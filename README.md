# hack-o-mat vending machine

* so like the triac chips we tried, none of them were good enough for the motors in the vending machine.

* MOC3021 would work once and then fail closed, running the motor forever and smoking

* FOD420 did the same thing basically, although one of them worked a few times first

* TLP3023 never worked at all, probably because they're only rated for 100mA and died instantly

* not sure what part to try next
